# guise

__A portable game UI library__

Development is very much in progress, but we try to keep the main branch usable.

There is no documentation yet, but there is a working example:
`guise_example_winit_wgpu`, which uses `winit` for platform integration and
`wgpu` for rendering. The integration is in
`guise_example_winit_wgpu/src/main.rs`, the renderer is in
`guise_example/guise_renderer_wgpu.rs`, and the demo itself is in
`guise_example/guise_demo.rs`.
